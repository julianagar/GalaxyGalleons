        "human_sustainability": "Mercury, due to its close proximity to the Sun and extreme temperatures ranging from scorching hot to freezing cold, lacks the necessary conditions to sustain human life as we know it. Its lack of atmosphere and inhospitable environment make it uninhabitable for humans without significant technological advancements and protective infrastructure."
